# Final Project (PIA) :  Shopping Cart 
Store that will use the program: "The Fastest & Coolest - Market" 


>The objective of this program is to be able to create and innovate an old system of small conventional stores (such as the typical small store on a street corner and other examples of entrepreneurs who start with their small store).
So, it is a fact that innovation for these businesses is fundamental and essential, due to the fact of being at the technological forefront and to eliminate that “manual labor” of type the products for the store cashier.

## Project Plan
The tasks or facilities of my project will be:
* ** Product Categorization: ** The program is designed so that the store indicates to the programmer the products it sells with their respective prices and finally also indicates the category of each product. For the programmer to place them in such a way in the code.
-In this case, the store for which this program was designed indicated the products and the categories in which they sell it (aunt) -

   Example (Category: Fast Food -> Pizza (4 people), etc ...).
* ** Shopping Cart in order **: The program can generate in an orderly manner the categories (in each category its products together with the prices), all in order to visually see all the items in the store in order.
All with the purpose of watch at the end of the program (almost to confirm the order) the articles selected and the quantity.
Also, it is important to mention that in the selection process of the order      ** the program sends a notice to ask how many articles will be taken of a certain product (when the user select the product)**, after that question and respective answer, ** the program notifies or confirms to the user again when the article (s) is added along with the quantity that was ordered. **

* ** Option to delete products **: The program has the option of giving the user the possibility of eliminating certain products from the shopping cart that they previously selected. The user will have the freedom to decide whether or not to delete.
** -->If the user chooses not to delete ... then the program ends and their final ticket will be generated. **
**--> If the user chooses to delete ... then the program will throw up the selection menu to delete the necessary products. And then finally, the final ticket of the updated purchase will be generated.**

* ** Promotions / Discount Codes **: The program is designed to automatically apply various promotions or discount codes (depending on the conditions that each promotion or code implies). For this function the library time.h and math.h were used; Since the discount codes are managed after a certain total purchase amount ($) or for certain days of the week where certain categories of products are discounted.
** --PROMOS (Established in the Program): **
** -> Promotion: **From the 1000 pesos in purchase a discount of 15% is made (Just can be applied when there is not other promo of the Day in the categories of products selected).
** -> ProMONDAY:** 13% discount on all items in the "Sodas" category, every Monday at all hours. 
** -> ProTuesday & Wednesday:** 15% discount on all items in the "Fruits and Vegetables" category, every Tuesday and Wednesday at all hours. 
** -> ProThursday: **20% discount on all items in the "Basic Basket" category, every Thursday at all hours. 
** -> ProFriyay: **18% discount on all items in the "Fast Food" category, every Friday at all hours. 
** -> ProSatSunyay: **10% discount on all items in the category "Fast Food", "Sodas", and "Sweets", every Saturday and Sunday every hour. 

* ** IVA **: The program is designed to add 16% IVA to absolutely every purchase made without exception.

* ** Generate Ticket **: The program has the ability or facility to generate a ticket automatically through a Ticket.txt, which is automatically updated at the time of generating purchase after purchase.

** -> The ticket contains ** the name of the store, the products with the quantity purchased by the customer with the total purchase price; And it also includes the specification of the promotions or discount codes that were applied automatically in the purchase, the added IVA and with all that information, finally, the total price to pay also appears.**
